# Check for NA values in each variable

1) Model Development
```{r}
## Exploratory Analysis
xtabs(~ Country_name + Sex, data=attr)
```
```{r}
#Removing 2 observed values of age 144. Outliers
hist(loan_data$person_age, main = "Histogram of Person Age")
loan_data$z_score_age <- scale(loan_data$person_age)
# Define threshold
threshold <- 3

# Remove outliers based on threshold
loan_data <- loan_data[abs(loan_data$z_score_age) <= threshold, ]

# Remove the z_score_age column as it's no longer needed
loan_data$z_score_age <- NULL

# Check the dimensions of the filtered data
dim(loan_data)
```

```{r}
xtabs(~ loan_status + person_age, data=loan_data)
```

```{r}
#xtabs(~ loan_status + person_income, data=loan_data)
```


```{r}
xtabs(~ loan_status + person_emp_length, data=loan_data)
```

```{r}
xtabs(~ loan_status + loan_amnt, data=loan_data)
```

```{r}
#xtabs(~ loan_status + loan_int_rate, data=loan_data)
```

```{r}
xtabs(~ loan_status + loan_percent_income, data=loan_data)
```

```{r}
xtabs(~ loan_status + cb_person_cred_hist_length, data=loan_data)
```

```{r}
xtabs(~ loan_status + loan_grade, data=loan_data)
```

```{r}
xtabs(~ loan_status + cb_person_default_on_file, data=loan_data)
```
```{r}
str(loan_data)
```

```{r}
logistic_simple <- glm(loan_status ~ person_age, data=loan_data, family="binomial")
summary(logistic_simple)
```
Identifying if the model is good/bad 
check for intercept and person_age coefficient 
check for low AIC score
check for *** ie significant 

The intercept is the log(odds) a person will receive loan based on age. 
```{r}
## The intercept is the log(odds) a female will be unhealthy. This is because
## female is the first factor in "sex" (the factors are ordered,
## alphabetically by default,"female", "male")
## Now let's look at the second coefficient...
##   sexM        1.2737     0.2725   4.674 2.95e-06 ***
##
## sexM is the log(odds ratio) that tells us that if a sample has sex=M, the
## odds of being unhealthy are, on a log scale, 1.27 times greater than if
## a sample has sex=F.
#female.log.odds <- log(25 / 71)
#female.log.odds
# Now you know how these are calculated
#male.log.odds.ratio <- log((112 / 89) / (25/71))
#male.log.odds.ratio
```


2) Model Acceptance 
```{r}
#let's  see what this logistic regression predicts
predicted.data <- data.frame(probability.of.loan_status=logistic_simple$fitted.values,age=loan_data$person_age)
predicted.data
```


```{r}
# We can plot the data
#ggplot(data=predicted.data ,aes(x=age, y=probability.of.loan_status))+ geom_point(aes(color=age), size=5) + xlab("Age") + ylab("Predicted probability of getting a loan")

xtabs(~ probability.of.loan_status + age, data=predicted.data)

```
33 observations at age of 21 and probability of loan is 25%
57 observations at age of 22 and probability of loan is 31%
94 observations at age of 23 and probability of loan is 38%
96 observations at age of 24 and probability of loan is 45%
92 observations at age of 25 and probability of loan is 53%

The highest probability of getting a loan accepted is at the age of 25.  

3) Residual Analysis and Prediction
```{r}
logistic <- glm(loan_status ~ ., data=loan_data, family="binomial")
summary(logistic)
```

```{r}
predicted.data <- data.frame(probability.of.ls=logistic$fitted.values,ls=loan_data$loan_status)
predicted.data <- predicted.data[order(predicted.data$probability.of.ls, decreasing=FALSE),]
predicted.data$rank <- 1:nrow(predicted.data)
## Lastly, we can plot the predicted probabilities for each sample having
## heart disease and color by whether or not they actually had heart disease
ggplot(data=predicted.data, aes(x=rank, y=probability.of.ls)) +
geom_point(aes(color=ls), alpha=1, shape=4, stroke=2) +
xlab("Index") +
ylab("Predicted probability of getting a loan")
```

5) Model Accuracy 
```{r}
# Confusion matrix
conf_mat <- table(Actual = loan_data$loan_status, Predicted = ifelse(logistic$fitted.values > 0.5, "Approved", "Not-Approved"))
print(conf_mat)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy <- sum(diag(conf_mat)) / sum(conf_mat)
print(paste("Accuracy:", accuracy))

# Calculate precision
precision <- conf_mat["Approved", "Approved"] / sum(conf_mat[, "Approved"])
print(paste("Precision:", precision))

# Calculate recall
recall <- conf_mat["Approved", "Approved"] / sum(conf_mat["Approved", ])
print(paste("Recall:", recall))

# ROC curve
roc_obj <- roc(loan_data$loan_status, logistic$fitted.values)
plot(roc_obj, xlab="False Positive Percentage", ylab="True Postive Percentage", legacy.axes=TRUE, col="#377eb8", lwd=4, percent=TRUE, print.auc=TRUE)
```
Insights: 
The model only predicts 18 cases of Approved and 13 cases of not-approved correctly. 

The accuracy of the modelis approximately 7.06%. This indicates that the model's overall predictive accuracy is quite low.

Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted "Approved" loans out of all predicted "Approved" cases, is 9%, indicating that only a small fraction of cases predicted as "Approved" are actually "Approved".

The recall of the model is approximately 7.38%, indicating that the model correctly identifies only a small portion of "Approved" loans.

The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between "Approved" and "Not-Approved" loans.
The AUC value of 0.973 indicates that the model has good discriminatory power.

The model has high AUC value, but poor accuracy, precision, and recall suggesting that it may not be suitable for practical use.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
